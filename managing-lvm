# create and extend logical volume

# at first, attach the disks

$ cd /dev
$ ls /dev

# create a partition for both disks

$ gdisk xvdf

# linux LVM Hexa cod 8e00

# do same with xvdg

# Now initialize the disks

$ pvcreate /dev/xvdf1 /dev/xvdg1
$ pvdisplay

# Create a volume group

$ vgcreate battlestar /dev/xvdf1 /dev/xvdg1
$ vgdisplay

# Create a logical volume

$ lvcreate -n galactica -L 20G battlestar
$ lvdisplay

# You can view your finished device in the `/dev` directory. Here you should
find a directory called *battlestar*:

# Now mount the logical volume
# create a filesystem
$ mkfs -t xfs /dev/battlestar/galactica
$ mkdir /mnt/mydir
$ mount /dev/battlestar/galactica /mnt/mydir

# now check your mounted device
$ df -h

# for persistent change you can add it /etc/fstab

# Extending logical volume and volume groups

# make a new partition of the device that you want to add to volume group

$ gdisk /dev/xvdj
# run partprobe to register the new partition with the kernel

$ pvcreate /dev/xvdj1

$ vgextend battlestar /dev/xvdj1
$ vgdisplay

$ lvextend -L +20G /dev/battlestar/galactica
$ lvdisplay

Use lvdisplay to confirm the size changes. However,
if you run df -h you see that the operating system
still only recognizes 20G of that. We need to
use XFSâ€™s grow file system command to extend this:

$ xfs_growfs /mnt/mydir
