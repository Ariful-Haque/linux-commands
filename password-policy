# Three tools can be used
 passwd, usermod, chage

# create a user without access to interactive shell
 $ useradd user1
 $ passwd user1
 $ usermod -s /sbin/nologin user1

# To get information about password expiration date of a user

  $ chage -l user1

--  Expire = I can login but it will force me to change my password
-- inactive = I can't even login


# To know the date 40 days from today

  $Â date -d '+40days' +%F (+%F = yy-mm-dd)


# Now to expire a user
 $ chage -E $(date -d '+40days' +%F) user1
 $ chage -l user1
 $ chage -E -1 user1 (it will remove account expiration date)


# password expire
 $ chage -M 90 user1 ( password will expire at 90 days from now)


# Force an user to change his password during next login
 $ chage -d 0 user1  (it will expire everything)
 $ chage -l user1

# Inactive
 $ chage -I 5 user1 (5 days of inactivity after password has expired, will lock the user)


# an administrator has to unlock the user
 $ usermod -U user1
     or
 $ passwd -u user1
